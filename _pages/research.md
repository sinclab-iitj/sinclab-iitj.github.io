# Research

Our primary goal is to work in some of the emrging areas of computing systems. Broadly we keep an inter-disciplinary outlook where we attempt to solve problems that can potentially translate to products and devices. We aim for these products to be low cost, and marketable to the general population of the country.

Our goals are pursued by a team of faculty members who have diverse experience in the general area of computing systems. The faculty and students work in a close synergy with the industry towards producing tranlational research.

Here are some of the thematic areas and techniques that we currently work on:

**Research on Ubiquitous Computing**

The vision of Ubiquitous Computing lies in the capacity of embedding the 'computing' into the objects scattered around our surroundings in a way to make the whole existence invisible t0 human perception. The domain of ubiquitous or pervasive computing comprises a lot of inputs from sensors and sensing, mobile computing, communication perspective, ML/AI driven data analytics and so on. In this group  we focus on various problems in the domain including activity recognition, sentiment/behavior analysis, indoor localization, remote health monitoring, and ambient living to name a few. IoT security and data privacy, low-power communication, on-device computation, edge/fog supported in-network data processing, analysis of multimodal sensory data and mobility management are few challenges that we are closely pursuing to address the specified problems. Our research group is highly exposed to multidisciplinary collaborative research pursuing both the channels with Industry and Academia across the globe and is actively engaged in various research activities covering the disruptive technologies like Blockchain, Federated Learning, Industry 4.0, and Digital Twin.

**Toward Next Generation of Blockchain Using Improvized Bitcoin-NG**

The Bitcoin-Next Generation (NG) is a new blockchain protocol that is designed to scale the efficiency in terms of throughput and delay. Bitcoin-NG is a Byzantine fault-tolerant blockchain protocol( shown in Figure 1) robust to extreme churn and shares the same trust model as Bitcoin. Researchers are trying to extend their applications by integrating them with existing technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT). However, due to high computational power and high consensus delay, current blockchain protocols, such as Bitcoin, are not suitable for working with lightweight IoT devices. Moreover, they are not energy-efficient as the mining of blocks requires dedicated mining machines that consume electricity. However, protocols, such as Bitcoin-NG, are designed to reduce the consensus delay, but they still need high computational power and high energy. This article proposes a new mechanism for blockchain to reduce the consensus delay, reduce energy consumption, and increase the throughput by introducing a new leader election scheme in the blockchain.

**Secure and Energy-Efficient Message Communication Protocols for Internet of Vehicles** 
![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/respic/iov.png){: style="width: 250px; float: left; margin: 0px  10px"}
The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) offers an emerging paradigm that deals with interconnected vehicles interacting with the infrastructure, roadside units (RSUs), sensors, and mobile devices with a goal to sense, compute, store, and transmit vital information or data over a common channel while vehicles are moving. Secure and reliable communication and efficient ondevice performance are thus crucial challenges in this paradigm, particularly in presence of limited computation resources. This paper presents a novel secure and energy-efficient message communication system, called MComIoV, using a one-way hash function and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). We evaluate MComIoV through security proof and analysis against various attacks and verify its robustness. The proposed system is also implemented and tested on Raspberry Pi 3B+. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency in computation time, storage cost, communication overhead, and energy consumption.
