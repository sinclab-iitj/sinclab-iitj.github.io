# Research

Our primary goal is to work in some of the emrging areas of computing systems. Broadly we keep an inter-disciplinary outlook where we attempt to solve problems that can potentially translate to products and devices. We aim for these products to be low cost, and marketable to the general population of the country.

Our goals are pursued by a team of faculty members who have diverse experience in the general area of computing systems. The faculty and students work in a close synergy with the industry towards producing tranlational research.

Here are some of the thematic areas and techniques that we currently work on:

**Pervasive/Ubiquitous Computing.** 

**Networking and Communications.** 

**Applications Reasarch**

**Software Architectures.**

**High Performance Computing (HPC).** 

**Computer Architectures.** 

**IGNORE FOLLOWING.**

**Nanofabricated "Smart Tips"**.

One of the  projects back from my job-proposal is to develop nanofabricated STM tips. The idea behind these “smart tips” is to use the technologies that were developed over decades in nanofabrication and make them available for scanning probe by using a nano-device instead of the traditional STM tungsten tip. One gains the flexibility of using different functionalities that are known from the fields of nanofabrication and mesoscopic physics. We are collaborating with the group Simon Groeblacher at TU Delft to realize this concept, benefitting from their unparalleled micro/nano fabrication know how.  A prototype of a smart tip is shown to the left. See publications in Microsyst Nanoeng, Nanotechnology, and PRB.


**Strange Metals.** The strange metal phase might be the most mysterious phase of high-temperature superconductors. Here, the electrical resistivity grows linearly with temperature T in large areas of the phase diagram, with a mean free path that diminishes to a fraction of the interatomic distance. T-linear resistivity is often associated with quantum critical points and marginal-Fermi-liquid physics. In strange metals, the mystery seems to go even further: we deal with something that looks like a quantum critical phase over an extended range of the phase diagram instead of cumulating in a point. There exists no consistent theory for strange metals, leading to more adventurous new approaches including the holographic theories that use insights from quantum gravity to explain strange metals (a recent textbook on this was written by our colleagues at Leiden University, Schalm and Zaanen).
We are part of the 'Strange Metal consortium NL' that includes the groups of Hussey, Golden, van Heumen, Zaanen, Schalm, Stoof and Vandoren. 

**Magnetic fluctuations and electron spin resonance.**
