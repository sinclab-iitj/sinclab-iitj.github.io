  description:  In this work we treat HAR data stream, generated from a smart home setup, as a series of events and apply LSTM to perform feature extraction. We use the Aruba dataset from the CASAS project, where we apply LSTM to extract features and perform annotations and then apply standard classification techniques to recognize the different activities in the newly annotated data.
